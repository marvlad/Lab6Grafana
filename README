# After installing prometheus and grafana
# Run the Python scripts. The first script (ReadRawData2PrometheusFormat.py) reads the raw data (raw_log.txt ), and the second script (Expose2Localhost.py) exposes the values. 

prometheus --config.file=./localdb.yml

prometheus by defaul shows up in localhost:9090

------grafana----------
You need to start the Grafana service. Example:
brew services start grafana (in mac, but linux will be systemctl)
Grafana will show up in localhost:3000 by default
